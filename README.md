# GStreamerCppHelpers

Headers to simplify GStreamer usage from C++.

## For Whom Is This Useful?

Those who need to use GStreamer from C++, but do not want to use some complete C++ bindings for GStreamer.

These headers do not have external dependencies (other than GStreamer itself) and do not use introspection files neither.


## Currently available

* [GstPtr <>](GstPtr/README.md)
  
  A specialized SmartPointer for GStreamer objects.
